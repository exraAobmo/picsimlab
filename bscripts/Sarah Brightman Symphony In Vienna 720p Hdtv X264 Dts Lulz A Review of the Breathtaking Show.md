Sarah Brightman, the world-renowned soprano and classical crossover artist, delivered a spectacular performance in her Symphony Live in Vienna concert, which was recorded on 16 January 2008 at the majestic Stephansdom (St. Stephen's) Cathedral in Vienna, Austria. The concert, which was inspired by her Symphony album, featured a mix of pop, rock, classical and musical theatre songs, as well as duets with guest artists Alessandro Safina, Fernando Lima and Chris Thompson. The concert was originally only available as a premium for a donation to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States, but was later released on DVD and CD in March 2009.
